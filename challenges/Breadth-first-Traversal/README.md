# Challenge Summary

**this challenge isBreadth-first Traversal**

**i took some help by study with qusai**

## Challenge Description

**Write a breadth first traversal method which takes a Binary Tree as its unique input. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, traverse the input tree using a Breadth-first approach, and return a list of the values in the tree in the order they were encountered**

## Approach & Efficiency
_this problem can be solved by create function and make a traversal as breadth way insted of depth way._

## Big O
   #### breadthTraversal()
   time O (n)
   space O (1)
time is a big O(n), because there is a while loop to check for each branch in the tree.
