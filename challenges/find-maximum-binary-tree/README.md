# Challenge Summary

**this challenge find-Maximum-Value**

## Challenge Description

**Write an instance method called find-maximum-value. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return the maximum value stored in the tree. You can assume that the values stored in the Binary Tree will be numeric.**

## Approach & Efficiency
_this problem can be solved by create function and make a traversal as breadth way insted of depth way._

## Big O
   #### findMaximumValue()
    time O (n)
   space O (1)
time is a big O(n), because there is a cyclic walk to check for each branch in the tree.
