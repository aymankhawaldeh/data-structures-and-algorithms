# Challenge Summary

**This challenge is Repeted Word**

## Challenge Description

**a function called tree_intersection that takes two binary tree parameters.Without utilizing any of the built-in library methods available to your language, return a set of values found in both trees.**

## Approach & Efficiency
_should accept tow binaray tree and return a set of values found in both trees._

## Big O
   #### tree_intersection()
   time O (n)
   space O (n)
time is a big O(n), because there is no ant type loop to check for each element in the array.
