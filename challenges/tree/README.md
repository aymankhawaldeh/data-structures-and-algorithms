# Challenge 15

# Binary Tree and BST Implementation

# Challenge Summary
this challenge is about working with Binary trees, and Binary search trees, by creating a Node class that instantiate a new node with left and right, fot the child nodes.

## Challenge Description
create a node class that instantiate a node with left and right, create methods that traverse through the Tree, using the depth first approach, the preOrder, inOrder, and postOrder methods are used. and for the binary search tree create a method that adds a node in the right place, and a method called contain that returns a Boolean if the value exists in the tree or not.

## Approach & Efficiency
in the binary tree traversing methods, the recursion method is used, by following the ordering of the traverse methods. 

### Big O
   ##### preOrder()
    time O (n)
    space O (1)
    the time is O(n), because of recursion, and the space O(1), because no operations are done for the variables.
   
   ##### inOrder()
    time O (n)
    space O (1)
    the time is O(n), because of recursion, and the space O(1), because no operations are done for the variables.
    
   ##### postOrder()
    time O (n)
    space O (1)
    the time is O(n), because of recursion, and the space O(1), because no operations are done for the variables.
