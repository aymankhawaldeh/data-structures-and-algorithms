# Challenge Summary

**this challenge is fizz-buzz-Tree**

## Challenge Description

**this challenge is function that accepet a tree as argument determine whether or not the value of each node is divisible by 3, 5 or both.**
- If the value is divisible by 3, replace the value with `Fizz`
- If the value is divisible by 5, replace the value with `Buzz`
- If the value is divisible by 3 and 5, replace the value with `FizzBuzz`
- If the value is not divisible by 3 or 5, simply turn the number into a String.

## Approach & Efficiency
_this problem can be solved by create function that accepet a tree as argument and then make a if condition for determine the divisible of each value in the tree and make a change in the value depended in the requirement._

## Big O
   #### FizzBuzzTree()
   time O (n)
   space O (1)
time is a big O(n), because there is a cyclic walk to check for each branch in the tree.
